# Hi, I'm Priyank Shankar üëã

###  About me:
Hey! I'm Priyank, a final year CS student from India, a software developer who loves to build products that make this world a better place to live.
I usually like to work around **Android development**, **Backend development**, and while constantly polishing my skills in Android, I have also started learning **Ios** development and I am also trying to get my hands dirty in **Blockchain** too.

This summer I worked as an Android Dev Intern at **Jar**. I also contributed to Organic Maps in **Google Summer of Code 2022**, you can see my project [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2022/projects/51VM0qGG)
I have also worked as an Android Developer Intern at a bunch of startups, more deatils can be found in my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dg98QPshuoKTahdQVMfYD1GOS3FBqdGB/view?usp=drive_link)

I am constantly learning new things and I enjoy sharing what I have learned with others.

I love to [speak](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO1T_D7d5Vy8F7LS9p8w9X6o5wkt0lN_T) and have conducted a few sessions to encourage and mentor students toward **programming**, **open source**, and **Android Development**.

Right now I am looking for new opportunities while making personal projects and diving all into **Kotlin Multiplatform**
